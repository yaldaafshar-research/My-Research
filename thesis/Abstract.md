## A just-in-time training framework to support intern performance

- Abstract - Motivated interns with good base knowledge are a good source for building the companies. Unfortunately, organizations prefer to hire professionals since they do not have a practical setup for training or to save time. To support interns’ performance, we define a training framework which is adoptive towards companies’ different values and practices. In this framework, we make use of a training material complemented by direct access to subject matter experts (domain knowledge), then a JIT training will be provided to them while conducting a predefined project. We aim to measure the time and effort developers spend while implementing the project and bring them to productivity sooner. The data is collected from the Software Design and Architecture course and students’ course project in the next semester.
