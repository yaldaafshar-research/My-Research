- Industy role in collaboration wih universitis:
    1. Participating in industry advisoro boards
    2. Making donations
    3. Providing discount on equipment and software
    4. Encouraging employees to work with universities as adjunct faculty or guest lectures
    5. Sponsaring and speaking at faculty development workshops(Industry could assist with the cost of workshops, help to shape the material    and provide guest speakers for such workshops.)
    6. Providing grants to help develop new degree programs
    7. Providing scholarships and summer internships to students in these programs
    8. Providing support for realistic capstone projects
    9. modifying and updating employee position descriptions to raise the bar
    
- The problems and obstacles for achieving these goals:
    1. Industry executives, whose support is needed for these collaborations, want to understand the accrued benefits to their organization.
    2. Software engineering staff members change jobs often and they donâ€™t have loyalty to companies and vice-versa
    3. Industry, in many countries, is relluctant to invest in software engineering education since it is expensive
    4. Financial analysts are concerned with short-term results more than the long-term results
    5. Some organizations have little intersest in software engineering methods and just wanr software engineers who churn out software quickly
    6. Strategies for industry/university collaboration that work in one country or region may not work at all in another.

- In Ottawa university, it is now mandatory for undergraduate students to do four co-op work terms in industry. learn from what the students bring in terms of process and design knowledge, and the students bring back industrial experiences to discuss in the classroom
