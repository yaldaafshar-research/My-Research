## Experiences with a new Digitalized Concept for Teaching Control Theory as Minor Subject at a University of Applied Science

### Relevencies

[Paper's link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8725217")


 - The concept of this paper uses activating methods like blended learning and possibilities of digitalization of teaching implementing Just in Time Teaching and Peer Instruction. The basis for the new concept is the idea of constructive alignment.
 - The main goal is to improve the competence and satisfaction of students, and therefore the commitment of students to their studies.

### Take aways

- Since students' issues are cited anonymously without miss spelling or sentence structure correction, they will learn to write their answers more carefully during the semester. 
- Students contribute to finding answers by participating in discussions during attence phase.
- The blended learning approach has the advantage that every student may work at its own learning pace. Thus, this is one possibility to react to the increasing inhomogeneity of student abilities.

- **IV. REACTIONS AND FEEDBACK FROM THE STUDENTS**
    - At first, the student's reaction was reluctance because of the workload, since they spent twice as much effort in the
    preparation of one blended learning unit than for a classical lecture., but after a while they realize the positive effect of the mixture of different teaching approaches and learning materials.
    - In every semester more than 70% of the students took part in the voluntary practical work units. Most of them stated that these units were a useful contribution to understanding.
    - Most of the students wanted to have such a blended learning unit every second week.
- the students feeling of being competent was increased, which lead to an increase of students satisfaction and consequently an increase in the students commitment to their studies.
- Students tended to feel more autonomy while participating in that course. They had the feeling that they can use their time more
freely and can decide when to work on a specific topic for example.
- Students became more active in asking questions even when there was no special activating method used at that particular time

## Method

- In this course model, Before attending the class, students must read a teaching text on an elearning platform of the university. They should answer some questions based on the text and submit 24 hours before the attence phase starts.They may ask questions if there is still issues open. Furthermore, students shall write down some important points of the text. After that, it is the lecturer's responsibility to cluster questions and statements for further instruction and students will be granted points if they give meaningful question or statement.
- The answers are evaluted by means of elearning platform; however, they have an indirect influence on the student's overall performance.
- The lessons included theoritical knowledge, exercise and practical work.
- They used a mixture of blended learning and classical lectures.
- The learning text will be available on an eLearning platform, which gives the students the possibility to work with it at any time and any place independent of the attendance time and students will be able to compile the content of the lectures during the semester to continuously
complete their own library.

### Data

- Each class contains 50 students attending lectures.
- They observed more than 200 students over six semesters and presented their feedback on the course model.
