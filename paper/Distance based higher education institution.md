- Most of the studens in this paper are employements who work from home.
- The goal of this paper is to shift student's minds into a reflective, critical, holistic socio-technical view of software system that is relevent to their professional context.
- They described the modules in software engineering area for graduate and final year undergraduate students.


## Take aways:

- In this model, students are assigned a tutor and provided with printed and online learning materials which they study at their leisure, towards fixed-date assessment points, in their own social and professional context.
- Since course fees has increased in UK universities students see the degrees as commercial products and it puts pressure on UK universities to consider their output differently.
- This modules, whilst embedded in degrees, were designed to be as much as possible self-contained so that students could pick
and mix modules to suit their personal interests or professional needs, without necessarily taking a full degree.

### undergarduate context:

- With the web becoming a universal utility, and where outsourcing and globalisation mean that technical skills need to be at a higher level.
- The graduates would need to understand the issues surrounding:
    1. How different groups of people will develop, design, maintain, work and use software systems.
    2. How modelling and storing information, accessing services on mobile platforms and the cloud happen everywhere
    3. What is people's experience in fixed and mobile networks, as well as their experience in living with the devices and building for the IOT
    ,everywhere.

### Postgraduate context

-  The previous small modules(15 credit) allowed students to configure their study to suit their interests and needs. However, it led to many assignments and exams to get a Diploma or MSc qualification, making them less attractive.
- The OUâ€™s move to a qualification-focussed curriculum, led to a new postgraduate curriculum with 30-credit modules and explicit specialisations.
- The MSc research project must be aligned with the specialisation.
- the module for postgraduate students is more open_ended, reflective and contextualised assessment.
