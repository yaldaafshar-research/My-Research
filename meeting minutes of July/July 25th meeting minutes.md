- The five steps needs to be done for my research thesis:

    - 1. Learn Django, React and Github
    - 2. Create a training package based on the knowledge in the previous step
    - 3. Literature review in JIT training 
    - 4. Define a projet (couurse outline generator)
    - 5. Collect data from the Software Design and Architecture course as well as the course project in the next semester

- We can measure intern's mood in two ways:
    - 1. provide interns with step by step tutorial training
    - 2. Let the students learn themselves with JIT training

- Action items:

    - Learn scrum development framwork
    - Write the abstract of the thesis
    - Define deadlines for each of our plans
