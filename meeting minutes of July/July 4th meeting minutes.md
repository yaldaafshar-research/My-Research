
- Talked about:

- We should narrow the research domain by using "itern performance" instead of "developer performance"
- "A just-in-time training framework to support intern performance" would be our research topic
- How to collect data for developer training project:
    - Through analyzing:
     
        1. The performance of teams who participate in the upcoming hackathon
        2. The performance of 14 project members who work with Arash and Dr. Moshirpour
        3. A course which will be offered in Winter and the course delivery is based on just-in-time method   

- Other ideas about developer training:
    - Introdece a new technology and check the student's performance when learning the technology
    - Use eyetracking method to check correlation between interns and stackoverflow

- Action items for the next week: 
    - Set up a meeting with Dr. Behjat
    - Send an Email to Dr. Moshirpour and Niyousha and declare when the data ananomization process will be completed
    - Brain storm about research topics
    - Edit issue's names
