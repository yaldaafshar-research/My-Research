- We want our project to be software engineering based instead of education engineering
- Talked about the final research in details:
    1. Learn Django and React
    2. Design education module and sample projects in Django, React, Docker, Git to teach fron-end and full stack development to students
    3. Define a project for the students who register in ENSF 607 for Fall 2020. The project can be the Course Outline Generator
    4. As a TA help them with the project and measure their performance, for example design surveys to see what students are doing and helping  them(JITT method) 
    5. In Winter semester, during their project course collect data about their performance
    6. Look at the project as a manager not a teacher to make the projects more practical
